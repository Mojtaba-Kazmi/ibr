## Small Bathroom Renovations in Melbourne – Smart Solutions for Compact Spaces

Renovating a small bathroom in Melbourne? Whether you’re dealing with a compact ensuite or a tight apartment space, making the most of every square meter is key. Here are expert-approved space-saving ideas to transform your small bathroom into a stylish and functional retreat.

### 1. Optimize Your Layout for Maximum Efficiency
A well-planned layout is crucial in small bathroom renovations. Consider these space-efficient designs:

- **Corner sinks & toilets** – Free up floor space with smart positioning.
- **Wall-mounted vanities** – Create an illusion of space and improve storage.
- **Sliding doors** – Save room compared to traditional swing doors.

### 2. Use Light Colors & Reflective Surfaces
Light colors can make small bathrooms feel more spacious. Try:

- **Neutral or pastel tones** – White, beige, and soft blues enhance openness.
- **Glossy tiles & mirrors** – Reflect natural light and add depth.
- **Glass shower screens** – Provide a seamless, airy look.

### 3. Invest in Smart Storage Solutions
Maximize every inch with innovative storage:

- **Recessed wall shelves** – Built-in niches for toiletries and decor.
- **Over-the-toilet storage** – Floating shelves or slim cabinets.
- **Multi-functional furniture** – Vanity units with hidden compartments.

### 4. Choose Compact Fixtures & Fittings
Modern bathroom designs include space-saving fixtures such as:

- **Wall-hung toilets** – Free up floor area for a cleaner look.
- **Narrow-depth vanities** – Maintain storage without overcrowding.
- **Compact bathtubs** – Shorter but deeper tubs for small spaces.

### 5. Improve Lighting & Ventilation
Proper lighting and airflow enhance functionality:

- **LED downlights** – Brighten dark corners without taking up space.
- **Skylights or large windows** – Bring in natural light where possible.
- **Exhaust fans** – Prevent moisture buildup and mold growth.
